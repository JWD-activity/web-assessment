## Description
This project is a creating a one-page responsive website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for a car agency listing vintage cars for hire. I focused on making sure that the web page layout is displayed in the appropriate size depending on the screen size of the user such as navbar, cards, images and form and I also embedded google map showing the location.
